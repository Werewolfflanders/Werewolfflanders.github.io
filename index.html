                  <p>This is the text thats going in here. Yea tons of text. You won't even believe it. Anceint text, modern text, you name it, we got it here. Here's some right now, it reads,"How the heck are ya, Bob? Well, aren't you a sight for sore eyes?" I don't know who comes up with this stuff but it's bloody brilliant. Let's keep going. We don't have enough text to fill the container. I know you have it inside you to fill the space. You can do it. You're almost there. There's no turning back now. It has to be done. Good job! You made it!</p>
                  
                  <p>A specific analogy that Baudrillard uses is a fable derived from "On Exactitude in Science" by Jorge Luis Borges. In it, a great Empire created a map that was so detailed it was as large as the Empire itself. The actual map was expanded and destroyed as the Empire itself conquered or lost territory. When the Empire crumbled, all that was left was the map. In Baudrillard's rendition, it is conversely the map that people live in, the simulation of reality where the people of Empire spend their lives ensuring their place in the representation is properly circumscribed and detailed by the map-makers; conversely, it is reality that is crumbling away from disuse.</p>
